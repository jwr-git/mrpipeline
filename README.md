# Combined MR-Coloc Pipeline 

This package combines Mendelian randomisation (MR) and colocalisation (coloc) with the aim of providing causal evidence between exposure-outcome pairs. The pipeline favours molecular data as exposure, for example, gene expression or protein abundance quantitative trait loci (QTLs), but can be used for non-molecular exposures as well. The pipeline will also annotate and combine results with drug target-related evidence from the literature, and has functionality to output shareable reports between investigators.

# How to Install

Within R, the package can be installed for this GitHub like so:

```remotes::install_github("https://github.com/jwr-git/mrpipeline")```

# Documentation

See here: _coming soon_

# Docker

A docker image will also be available soon.
